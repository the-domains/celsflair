**About me**

Hi, I'm Celica. I worked as a Telecom Engineer for 10 years before we moved here in Seattle and became a stay-at-home Mom for 6 years. Now, I work part-time and still a full-time Mom.

Pinterest has been a great help for me in exploring new ideas but I try to add some twist or pinch of my own ideas that could maybe add a twist to your ideas too. Over the years, I wanted to have something to link my own posts at Pinterest, Tumblr or Google+. A home where I can post my own photos and say more of my ideas. Finally, I decided to give it a try. So I hope to learn more, try new ones, do some more and discover more so I can continue this new journey with you through Celsflair.
